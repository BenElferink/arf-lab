          Anatomy NFT was created by NFT enthusiasts, and the art created is top notch. Unfortunately due to some complications within the Lab some
          experiments failed and barely made it.

          <strong className='text-zinc-200'>Experiment I</strong> was the release of Anatomies on the Cardano Blockchain, this was a success.

          <strong className='text-zinc-200'>Experiment II</strong> was evolving these Anatomies into Bionic Anatomies, this is where some problems
          started to occur! The evolution of the Bionics was the only one that made it!

          <strong className='text-zinc-200'>Experiment III</strong> &amp; <strong className='text-zinc-200'>Experiment IIII</strong> were the Animal
          and Human evolutions, which never saw the light of day! These experiments where scrapped for the time-being, but we haven&apos;t given up
          just yet, and created Experiment 0.

        <p className='my-4 text-zinc-400'>
          <strong className='text-zinc-200'>Experiment 0</strong> is created in the form of a token called $LAB, with this we&apos;ll build our
          foundation, and one day we&apos;ll see if we could revive the unfulfilled experiments.
